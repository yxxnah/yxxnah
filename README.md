### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I started my career as a back-end development and worked as an engineer in 2016 and recently changed my job as a data engineer. 
Analyzing and impacting live products and businesses was much more fun than making products myself, and I was fascinated by data and analysis and now dreams of a career as a data analyst.
